# Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview 
* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the data set to understand it and make some accurate discovery.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. 
* Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. 


## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn,pickle

## Data Cleaning
After scraping the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed numeric data out of salary 
*	Made columns for employer provided salary and hourly wages 
*	Removed rows without salary 
*	Parsed rating out of company text 
*	Made a new column for company state 
*	Added a column for if the job was at the company’s headquarters 
*	Transformed founded date into age of company 
*	Made columns for if different skills were listed in the job description:
    * Python  
    * R  
    * Excel  
    * AWS  
    * Spark 
*	Column for simplified job title and Seniority
